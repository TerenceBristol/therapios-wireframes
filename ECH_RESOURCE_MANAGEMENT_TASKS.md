# ECH Resource Management Wireframe - Task List

**Project**: Therapios Wireframes - ECH Resource Management Feature
**Date Created**: January 2025
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (All Phases Complete) → 🔄 **REFACTORING** (Transform to Matching Tool)

## Overview
Creating a new wireframe called **"ECH & Resource Management"** that will appear in the draft wireframes section. This single wireframe contains 5 sub-pages for managing therapist assignments to Elderly Care Homes (ECH). The system will help administrators efficiently assign therapists to ECHs based on location, specialty, and availability.

### Terminology
- **ECH**: Elderly Care Home (Elderly Care Home)
- **VO**: Prescription (Verordnung)

## Project Structure
- **Main Wireframe**: "ECH & Resource Management"
